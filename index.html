        <h3>Protect the watersheds in your area</h3>
        <p>
          Watersheds are areas of land that channel water into rivers and
          creeks. Keeping these areas clean will help maintain healthy
          watersheds.

        <h3>Water your lawn sparingly at certain hours</h3>
        <p>
          If you water during the day when the sun is out, the water will
          evaporate much more quickly. Instead, water during the morning or
          evening. Lawns also don't need to be watered every day. Watering once
          every three days is enough to keep your lawn healthy.

        <p>
          All sorts of appliances in your home can leak. Some include faucets,
          shower heads, and dishwashers. Make sure to inform someone whenever
          you find a leak to get it fixed.

        <p>
          Refill the bottle or cup you're using instead of getting a new one.
          This cuts back on the number of dishes that need to get washed.

        <p>
          Every minute trimmed from a shower will save 3 to 6 gallons of water,
          so try to keep your shower times as short as possible!

        <p>
          Left unattended, a running garden hose can waste over 100 gallons of
          water in just minutes. Put a nozzle on your hose so you only use what
          you need when you're watering the plants, cleaning the house, or
          washing the car.

        <h3>Don't let the faucet run too long</h3>
        <p>
          When you're in the bathroom, turn off the tap while brushing your
          teeth. In the kitchen, use a dishpan to hold soapy water and then
          rinse dishes with clean water quickly.

        <h3>Never use the toilet to throw away trash</h3>
        <p>
          Throwing trash in the toilet can use a lot of unnecessary water with
          each flush. It also has the potential to clog up your plumbing which
          is expensive to fix.
